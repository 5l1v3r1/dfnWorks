NOTE: FRACTUES WILL NOT CONNECT ON AN EDGE
      This is an unfinished test case due 
      to the code not having the ability 
      to detect the correct intersection 
      when fractures are touching on their
      edges. Intersection algorithm must be 
      re-written for the software to gain this
      functionality.



Tests fractures connecting on their edge

Pass: 
    Any case where the edges of two fractures
    connect with a distances less then eps
      
Fail: 
    Cases where fractures lay on the same plane
    and overlap with distance greater than eps
      

File names that end with _pass.dat should pass

File names that end with _fail.dat should reject all fractures
